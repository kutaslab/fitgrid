`fitgrid` is a Python library for modelling time-varying patterns of
activity in sensor-array data streams.

The original application was regression modeling event-related brain
potentials in human EEG as described in [SmiKut2015a]_

The approach generalizes readily to other types of regularly sampled
synchronized data streams such as MEG and polygraph recordings, ECoG,
eye-movements, event-related fMRI, weather stations, buoy arrays, and
the Internet-of-Things.
