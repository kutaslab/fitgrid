"""Simulated epochs data
========================

Use `fitgrid.generate()` to quickly generate small or large random
data sets with categorical and random continuous predictor
variables. The random values can be seeded for replicability.

The data can be returned in native fitgrid.Epochs format for immediate
modeling or as a pandas.DataFrame. The latter is useful for mocking up
the conversion from a dataframe to fitgrid.Epochs when developing an
analysis pipeline.

Small data sets are useful for trying out features and
functions. Larger sets are useful for testing system performance and
limitations.
